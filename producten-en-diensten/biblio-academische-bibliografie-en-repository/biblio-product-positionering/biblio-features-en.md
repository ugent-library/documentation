## Repository

### Yes <mark style="color:green;">`verified`</mark>

#### Search and Discovery

Robust search and discovery functionalities are essential for researchers to easily locate relevant academic content within the repository. This includes advanced search options, filters, and metadata indexing.

#### Content Hosting

The primary function is to host and archive various types of academic content, including preprints, postprints, datasets, multimedia files, and other research outputs.

#### Open Access

Institutional repositories often prioritize open access, making research freely available to the public. This aligns with the principles of transparency and the democratization of knowledge.

#### Integration with Other Systems

Integration with other academic systems, such as institutional websites, research management tools, and publication databases, helps streamline workflows and ensure consistency across platforms.

### Not (yet) <mark style="color:red;">`TBD`</mark>

#### Usage Statistics (needs to be ethical)

Providing analytics and usage statistics allows administrators and researchers to understand how often and in what ways the repository is being utilized, helping in assessing its impact.

#### Version Control

To track the evolution of research, version control features ensure that different versions of a document or dataset are preserved, allowing researchers to refer to and compare previous iterations.

#### Collaboration Tools (explore other channels used now – will not build ourselves)

Description: Some repositories integrate collaboration tools, enabling researchers to work together on shared projects, provide feedback, and engage in discussions directly within the platform.

#### DOI Assignment (why don’t we? should we? other tool?)

Assigning Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs) to documents enhances their citability and ensures a persistent link, contributing to the long-term accessibility and recognition of the research.

## Bibliography

### Yes <mark style="color:green;">`verified`</mark>

#### Reference Management

A bibliography tool supports the organization and management of references, enabling researchers to compile, organize, and format citations for their academic work.

#### Citation Styles

The ability to format citations in various styles (APA, MLA, Chicago, etc.) ensures that researchers can adhere to specific citation requirements for different publications.

#### Import and Export

Description: Bibliography tools allow users to import references from various sources and export them in different formats, enhancing flexibility and interoperability.

#### Collaboration and Sharing

Collaboration features enable researchers to share bibliographies with colleagues.

### Not (yet?) <mark style="color:red;">`TBD`</mark>

#### Collaboration and Sharing PT2

Collaboration features enable researchers to collaborate on reference lists, and maintain a collective database of references.

#### Annotated References <mark style="color:blue;">`partial support`</mark>

The ability to add annotations to references allows researchers to include additional context, summaries, or notes about each source in their bibliography.

#### Integration with Writing Software <mark style="color:red;">`we will not`</mark>

Description: Seamless integration with word processing software (e.g., Microsoft Word, LaTeX) simplifies the citation process, allowing researchers to insert and format references directly in their manuscripts.

#### Web Browser Extensions <mark style="color:red;">`we will not`</mark>

Browser extensions enable users to quickly capture and organise references while browsing online content, making it convenient to build bibliographies on the fly.
